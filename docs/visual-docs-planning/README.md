# 📁 Visual Documentation Planning

This folder contains all planning, tracking, and error investigation files for the Fireplexity visual documentation project.

## 📋 File Structure

### Core Planning Files
- **`MASTER_PLAN.md`** - Main visual documentation roadmap and progress tracker
- **`PROGRESS_LOG.md`** - Detailed log of daily achievements and milestones
- **`ERROR_INVESTIGATIONS/`** - Subfolder for error investigation plans

### Error Investigation Pattern
When errors are encountered during documentation creation:

1. **Spawn Investigation File**: Create `ERROR_INVESTIGATIONS/error-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md`
2. **Document Error**: Record the error, context, and investigation steps
3. **Track Resolution**: Document the fix and return point in main plan
4. **Update Master Plan**: Mark resolution and continue with documentation

## 🔄 Workflow
1. Always check `MASTER_PLAN.md` for current status
2. Update progress as tasks are completed
3. If errors occur, create investigation file and resolve
4. Return to master plan and continue from last checkpoint

## 📊 Quick Status
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Core Search Features
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-05

This system ensures we never lose track of progress and can systematically handle any issues that arise.
