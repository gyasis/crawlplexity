# 🚨 Error Investigation: Server Connection Issue

**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**Error Type**: Development server connection refused  
**Context**: Setting up Playwright for visual documentation  

## 🔍 Problem Description
- Development server started with `npm run dev` 
- Server reported "Ready in 2.2s" at http://localhost:18563
- Playwright and curl both getting connection refused errors
- Need server running for Phase 1 visual documentation

## 📊 Investigation Steps

### ✅ Completed Checks
- [x] Started dev server with `npm run dev`
- [x] Server reported successful startup
- [x] Attempted Playwright navigation
- [x] Attempted curl connection test

### ✅ Investigation Completed
- [x] Check if server process is actually running - **Process was not running**
- [x] Verify port 18563 is available and listening - **Port was available**
- [x] Check for any startup errors in server logs - **No errors found**
- [x] Test alternative connection methods - **Background process worked**

### 🔧 Resolution Applied
**Root Cause**: Initial server process terminated after timeout
**Solution**: Started server in background with logging: `npm run dev > server.log 2>&1 &`
**Verification**: Curl test returned HTTP 200 OK

### 🛠️ Potential Solutions
1. **Check Server Process**: Verify npm process is running
2. **Port Investigation**: Check if port 18563 is bound correctly
3. **Server Logs**: Review any hidden startup errors
4. **Alternative Start**: Try different startup command
5. **Firewall/Network**: Check local networking issues
