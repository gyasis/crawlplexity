# AI agent orchestration: The CIO‚Äôs crucial next step

##  As companies deploy dozens of AI agents and LLMs, they will need to control and connect them all through an orchestration and integration platform, experts say. 
![AI agent orchestration](https://www.cio.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/4021176-0-57925200-1752573831-agentic_ai_orchestration_shutterstock_2653448151.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024)

In the near agentic AI future, enterprises will run dozens if not hundreds of AI agents, with CIOs in charge of orchestrating and connecting them to help employees navigate a range of interconnected business processes.
Take onboarding a new employee. In the not distant future, an HR rep might ask a chatbot to set up the new employee. By coordinating several agents, the chatbot would in turn enter the employee into the payroll system, walk her through health insurance options, and set up her email and videoconferencing services. Further agent coordination could also deliver the new employee training, issue a building entry badge, and even ship her a laptop or assign her a desk, all with minimal human input.
This vision of AI orchestration and integration is already being rolled out by some companies, and as organizations deploy multiple large language models (LLMs) and dozens of AI agents in the coming years, mass adoption of AI integration and orchestration tools is likely.
By 2028, 70% of organizations building multi-LLM applications and [AI agents](https://www.cio.com/article/3603856/agentic-ai-promising-use-cases-for-business.html) will use integration platforms to optimize and orchestrate connectivity and data access, Gartner predicted in [a recent report](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/6580502). Less than 5% of similar organizations were using AI integration platforms in 2024.
Some AI experts see that orchestration function, where many AI agents are tied together to create wide-ranging and autonomous workflows, as the point when [agents become agentic](https://www.cio.com/article/4003880/how-ai-agents-and-agentic-ai-differ-from-each-other.html).
## Connecting data and decision-makers
AI integration and orchestration tools will be vital for most enterprises because [AI agents](https://www.cio.com/article/3496519/agentic-ai-decisive-operational-ai-arrives-in-business.html) and LLMs need to be connected to fully reach their potential, says [Andrew Humphreys](https://www.gartner.com/en/experts/andrew-humphreys), a senior director and analyst at Gartner. Recent releases of [several agent protocols](https://www.cio.com/article/3991302/ai-protocols-set-standards-for-scalable-results.html) take the first step toward this widespread integration, he notes.
‚ÄúAI has to have access to data in order to make decisions, and it has to have the ability to actually take some kind of action,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAn agent is useless if it can‚Äôt have access to data, and it can‚Äôt make a decision.‚Äù
Agent integration and orchestration will help CIOs address several emerging questions about the coming agentic AI world, he adds. ‚ÄúHow do I make it easier for my AI developer or my agent to be able to connect to things and get data?‚Äù Humphreys says. ‚ÄúHow can I observe what‚Äôs actually happening within my IT architecture?‚Äù
As CIOs‚Äô AI strategies become more complex, the need for agent orchestration platforms becomes readily apparent, adds [Beth Scagnoli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beth-scagnoli/), vice president of product management at data readiness solution provider Redpoint Global.
‚ÄúMost organizations today aren‚Äôt just experimenting with a single AI model; they‚Äôre working across multiple LLMs, legacy systems, and newer AI agents simultaneously,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWithout orchestration, that ecosystem risks quickly becoming fragmented, redundant, and inefficient.‚Äù
The orchestration layer will manage how AI tools access, move, and act on data across systems, she adds. ‚ÄúThis is not just for outputs, but also for maintaining enterprise standards around governance and trust,‚Äù Scagnoli says. ‚ÄúAI orchestration is quickly becoming the critical link between data strategy and AI execution.‚Äù
## A market emerges
CIOs adding orchestration tools should look for interoperability, Scagnoli says.
‚ÄúOrchestration layers that are flexible and AI-agnostic will be where the true value shines,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúTools that can sit above any LLM or agent, allowing for organizations to plug in the right model for the job all while managing security, versioning, and data lineage behind the scenes,‚Äù will be IT leaders‚Äô best bet.
Gartner‚Äôs Humphreys sees a burgeoning marketplace for AI integration and orchestration platforms, with many small players currently offering out-of-the-box solutions. As the market becomes more profitable, larger IT and AI players will get into the game.
Some companies will also build orchestration tools themselves, Humphreys says, but he urges IT leaders to take the lessons learned from past integration efforts, including orchestration of API calls.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve probably already put together your existing API integrations,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúTweak that rather than thinking that you‚Äôve got to completely reinvent the whole bit. Just adjust that to meet the way that your AI needs to talk to it, rather than thinking, ‚ÄòOh, it‚Äôs AI, I‚Äôd better rewrite everything I‚Äôve learned in the past.‚Äô‚Äù
## Experimenting with orchestration
IBM is one company that‚Äôs taking on agent integration in house. The tech giant began experimenting with agent-like tools eight years ago, and it now has agents deployed in several workflows, including IBM‚Äôs sales and [IT departments](https://www.cio.com/article/4018133/its-time-to-retire-the-ticket-an-it-roadmap-for-agentic-ai.html), says [Suzanne Livingston](https://www.linkedin.com/in/solivingston/), vice president at IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agent Domains. HR was the early test case, and now, agents operate many HR functions.
‚ÄúThere are a lot of processes in HR, and it‚Äôs difficult for employees to understand how to work with the HR system,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe use one [app] at the time, and if you‚Äôve ever used one of these enterprise HR systems, you had to find the instructions to know exactly what you wanted to do. And, by the way, those instructions changed every month.‚Äù
Now, IBM employees can interact with an AI agent to create salary increase requests, transfer employees between departments, create job descriptions, and accomplish a range of other HR functions, she says. An AI orchestration layer is needed to interact with the agents operating all those individual HR tools to accomplish multistep workflows, such as employee onboarding, she notes.
Still, for most companies, a vendor-supported out-of-the-box tool may be an easier way to get started, Livingston says.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great way to not have to start by building something from scratch,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great way to trial it out and get a feel for it, and then, it may lead you to bigger projects as a result, but it is useful on its own.‚Äù
She also suggests that CIOs look for [low-hanging fruit where there are a lot of employee pain points](https://www.cio.com/article/3829620/how-to-know-a-business-process-is-ripe-for-agentic-ai.html), for example, time-off requests. ‚ÄúEveryone has to submit time off, and no, no one wants to do it because it is clunky,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs an easy one to get started with, and you get immediate value.‚Äù
The future will be agents everywhere, Livingston adds.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a never-ending realm of underlying agents,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAs companies evolve and bring on board new processes, or reduce complexity of processes, it‚Äôs its own positive loop of an experience.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting companies to adopt that mindset, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt have to train my employees on 500 different systems, I can help them understand how to utilize the benefit of these systems through an agent.‚Äô‚Äù

As architects and developers design their workload to take full advantage of language model capabilities, AI agent systems become increasingly complex. These systems often exceed the abilities of a single agent that has access to many tools and knowledge sources. Instead, these systems use multi-agent orchestrations to handle complex, collaborative tasks reliably. This guide covers fundamental orchestration patterns for multi-agent architectures and helps you choose the approach that fits your specific requirements.
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#overview)
## Overview
When you use multiple AI agents, you can break down complex problems into specialized units of work or knowledge. You assign each task to dedicated AI agents that have specific capabilities. These approaches mirror strategies found in human teamwork. Using multiple agents provides several advantages compared to monolithic single-agent solutions.
  * **Specialization:** Individual agents can focus on a specific domain or capability, which reduces code and prompt complexity.
  * **Scalability:** Agents can be added or modified without redesigning the entire system.
  * **Maintainability:** Testing and debugging can be focused on individual agents, which reduces the complexity of these tasks.
  * **Optimization:** Each agent can use distinct models, task-solving approaches, knowledge, tools, and compute to achieve its outcomes.


The patterns in this guide show proven approaches for orchestrating multiple agents to work together and accomplish an outcome. Each pattern is optimized for different types of coordination requirements. These AI agent orchestration patterns complement and extend traditional [cloud design patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/) by addressing the unique challenges of coordinating autonomous components in AI-driven workload capabilities.
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#sequential-orchestration)
## Sequential orchestration
The sequential orchestration pattern chains AI agents in a predefined, linear order. Each agent processes the output from the previous agent in the sequence, which creates a pipeline of specialized transformations.
[ ![Diagram that shows sequential orchestration where agents process tasks in a defined pipeline order. Output flows from one agent to the next.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/sequential-pattern.svg) ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/sequential-pattern.svg#lightbox)
[ The image shows several sections that have arrows and connecting lines. An arrow points from Input to Agent 1. A line connects Agent 1 to a section that reads Model, knowledge, and tools. An arrow points from Agent 1 to Agent 2. A line connects Agent 2 to a section that reads Model, knowledge, and tools. An arrow points from Agent 2 to a box that has ellipses. An arrow points from this box to Agent n. A line connects Agent n to a section that reads Model, knowledge, and tools. An arrow points from Agent n to Result. A section that reads Common state spans the Agent 1 section through the Agent n section.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/sequential-pattern.svg#lightbox)
[ ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/sequential-pattern.svg#lightbox)
The sequential orchestration pattern solves problems that require step-by-step processing, where each stage builds on the previous stage. It suits workflows that have clear dependencies and improve output quality through progressive refinement. This pattern resembles the [Pipes and Filters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/pipes-and-filters) cloud design pattern, but it uses AI agents instead of custom-coded processing components. The choice of which agent gets invoked next is deterministically defined as part of the workflow and isn't a choice given to agents in the process.
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#when-to-use-sequential-orchestration)
### When to use sequential orchestration
Consider the sequential orchestration pattern in the following scenarios:
  * Multistage processes that have clear linear dependencies and predictable workflow progression
  * Data transformation pipelines, where each stage adds specific value that the next stage depends on
  * Workflow stages that can't be parallelized
  * Progressive refinement requirements, such as _draft, review, polish_ workflows
  * Systems where you understand the availability and performance characteristics of every AI agent in the pipeline, and where failures or delays in one AI agent's processing are tolerable for the overall task to be accomplished


[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#when-to-avoid-sequential-orchestration)
### When to avoid sequential orchestration
Avoid this pattern in the following scenarios:
  * Stages are [embarrassingly parallel](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel). You can parallelize them without compromising quality or creating shared state contention.
  * Processes that include only a few stages that a single AI agent can accomplish effectively.
  * Early stages might fail or produce low-quality output, and there's no reasonable way to prevent later steps from processing by using accumulated error output.
  * AI agents need to collaborate rather than hand off work.
  * The workflow requires backtracking or iteration.
  * You need dynamic routing based on intermediate results.


[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#sequential-orchestration-example)
### Sequential orchestration example
A law firm's document management software uses sequential agents for contract generation. The intelligent application processes requests through a pipeline of four specialized agents. The sequential and predefined pipeline steps ensure that each agent works with the complete output from the previous stage.
[ ![Diagram that shows sequential orchestration where a document creation pipeline is implemented with agents.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/sequential-pattern-example.svg) ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/sequential-pattern-example.svg#lightbox)
[ The image shows several sections that have arrows and connecting lines. An arrow points from Document creation requirements to Template selection agent. A line connects the Template section agent to a section that reads Model, template library, and research tools. An arrow points from the Template selection agent to the Clause customization agent. A line connects the Clause customization agent to a section that reads Fine-tuned model. An arrow points from the Clause customization agent to the Regulatory compliance agent. A line connects the Regulatory compliance agent to a section that reads Model, regulatory knowledge. An arrow points from the Regulatory compliance agent to the Risk assessment agent. A line connects the Risk assessment agent to a section that reads Model, liability knowledge, and persistence tools. An arrow points from the Risk assessment agent to a section that reads Proposed document. A section that reads Document state spans the Clause customization agent to the Proposed document section.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/sequential-pattern-example.svg#lightbox)
[ ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/sequential-pattern-example.svg#lightbox)
  1. The _template selection agent_ receives client specifications, like contract type, jurisdiction, and parties involved, and selects the appropriate base template from the firm's library.
  2. The _clause customization agent_ takes the selected template and modifies standard clauses based on negotiated business terms, including payment schedules and liability limitations.
  3. The _regulatory compliance agent_ reviews the customized contract against applicable laws and industry-specific regulations.
  4. The _risk assessment agent_ performs comprehensive analysis of the complete contract. It evaluates liability exposure and dispute resolution mechanisms while providing risk ratings and protective language recommendations.


[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#concurrent-orchestration)
## Concurrent orchestration
The concurrent orchestration pattern runs multiple AI agents simultaneously on the same task. This approach allows each agent to provide independent analysis or processing from its unique perspective or specialization.
[ ![Diagram that shows concurrent orchestration where multiple agents process the same input task simultaneously and their results are aggregated.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/concurrent-pattern.svg) ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/concurrent-pattern.svg#lightbox)
[ The image contains three key sections. In the top section, an arrow points from Input to the Initiator and collector agent. An arrow points from the Initiator and collector agent to a section that reads Aggregated results based on combined, compared, and selected results. A line connects the Initiator and collector agent to a line that connects to four sections via arrows. These sections are Agent 1, Agent 2, an unlabeled section that has ellipses, and Agent n. An arrow points from Agent 1 to Intermediate result. A line points from Agent 1 and splits into two flows. The first flow shows a Sub agent 1.1 section and a section that reads Model, knowledge, and tools. The second flow shows a Sub agent 1.2 and a section that reads Model, knowledge and tools. An arrow points from Agent 2 to Intermediate result. A line connects Agent 2 to a section that reads Model, knowledge, and tools. An arrow points from the unlabeled section that has ellipses to Intermediate results. An arrow points from Agent n to Intermediate result. A line connects Agent n to a section that reads Model, knowledge, and tools.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/concurrent-pattern.svg#lightbox)
[ ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/concurrent-pattern.svg#lightbox)
This pattern addresses scenarios where you need diverse insights or approaches to the same problem. Instead of sequential processing, all agents work in parallel, which reduces overall run time and provides comprehensive coverage of the problem space. This orchestration pattern resembles the Fan-out/Fan-in cloud design pattern. The results from each agent are often aggregated to return a final result, but that's not required. Each agent can independently produce its own results within the workload, such as invoking tools to accomplish tasks or updating different data stores in parallel.
Agents operate independently and don't hand off results to each other. An agent might invoke extra AI agents by using its own orchestration approach as part of its independent processing. The available agents must know which agents are available for processing. This pattern supports both deterministic calls to all registered agents and dynamic selection of which agents to invoke based on the task requirements.
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#when-to-use-concurrent-orchestration)
### When to use concurrent orchestration
Consider the concurrent orchestration pattern in the following scenarios:
  * Tasks that you can run in parallel, either by using a fixed set of agents or by dynamically choosing AI agents based on specific task requirements.
  * Tasks that benefit from multiple independent perspectives or different specializations, such as technical, business, and creative approaches, that can all contribute to the same problem. This collaboration typically occurs in scenarios that feature the following multi-agent decision-making techniques:
    * Brainstorming
    * Ensemble reasoning
    * Quorum and voting-based decisions
  * Time-sensitive scenarios where parallel processing reduces latency.


[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#when-to-avoid-concurrent-orchestration)
### When to avoid concurrent orchestration
Avoid this orchestration pattern in the following scenarios:
  * Agents need to build on each other's work or require cumulative context in a specific sequence.
  * The task requires a specific order of operations or deterministic, reproducible results from running in a defined sequence.
  * Resource constraints, such as model quota, make parallel processing inefficient or impossible.
  * Agents can't reliably coordinate changes to shared state or external systems while running simultaneously.
  * There's no clear conflict resolution strategy to handle contradictory or conflicting results from each agent.
  * Result aggregation logic is too complex or lowers the quality of the results.


[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#concurrent-orchestration-example)
### Concurrent orchestration example
A financial services firm built an intelligent application that uses concurrent agents that specialize in different types of analysis to evaluate the same stock simultaneously. Each agent contributes insights from its specialized perspective, which provides diverse, time-sensitive input for rapid investment decisions.
[ ![Diagram that shows concurrent orchestration to evaluate a stock.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/concurrent-pattern-example.svg) ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/concurrent-pattern-example.svg#lightbox)
[ The image contains three key sections. In the top section, an arrow points from Ticker symbol to the Stock analysis agent. A line connects Model, exchange symbol mapping knowledge to the Stock analysis agent. An arrow points from the Stock analysis agent to a section that reads Decision with supporting evidence based on combined intermediate results. A line connects Stock analysis agent to a line that points to four separate sections. These sections are four separate flows: Fundamental analysis agent, Technical analysis agent, Sentiment analysis agent, and ESG agent. A line connects Model to the Fundamental analysis agent flow. An arrow points from Fundamental analysis agent flow to Intermediate result. A line points from the Fundamental analysis agent flow and splits into two flows: Financials and revenue analysis agent and Competitive analysis agent. A line connects Financials and revenue analysis agent to a section that reads Model, reported financials knowledge. A line connects Competitive analysis agent to a section that reads Model, competitive knowledge. An arrow points from Technical analysis agent to Intermediate result. A line connects Technical analysis agent to a section that reads Fine-tuned model, market APIs. An arrow points from Sentiment analysis agent to Intermediate result. A line connects Sentiment analysis agent to a section that reads Model, social APIs, news APIs. An arrow points from the ESG agent to Intermediate result. A line connects the ESG agent to a section that reads Model, ESG knowledge.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/concurrent-pattern-example.svg#lightbox)
[ ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/concurrent-pattern-example.svg#lightbox)
The system processes stock analysis requests by dispatching the same ticker symbol to four specialized agents that run in parallel.
  * The _fundamental analysis agent_ evaluates financial statements, revenue trends, and competitive positioning to assess intrinsic value.
  * The _technical analysis agent_ examines price patterns, volume indicators, and momentum signals to identify trading opportunities.
  * The _sentiment analysis agent_ processes news articles, social media mentions, and analyst reports to gauge market sentiment and investor confidence.
  * The _environmental, social, and governance (ESG) agent_ reviews environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practice reports to evaluate sustainability risks and opportunities.


These independent results are then combined into a comprehensive investment recommendation, which enables portfolio managers to make informed decisions quickly.
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#group-chat-orchestration)
## Group chat orchestration
The group chat orchestration pattern enables multiple agents to solve problems, make decisions, or validate work by participating in a shared conversation thread where they collaborate through discussion. A chat manager coordinates the flow by determining which agents can respond next and by managing different interaction modes, from collaborative brainstorming to structured quality gates.
[ ![Diagram that shows group chat orchestration where multiple agents participate in a managed conversation. A central chat manager coordinates the discussion flow.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/group-chat-pattern.svg) ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/group-chat-pattern.svg#lightbox)
[ The image shows several sections that have arrows and connecting lines. An arrow points from Input to Group chat manager. An arrow starts at Model, goes through Group chat manager, and points to Accumulating chat thread. A section below this line reads New group instructions based on accumulated context. A line connects to a section that reads Human chat participant or observer. An arrow points from Group chat manager to Agent 2. A double-sided arrow connects Agent 1, an unlabeled box that has ellipses, and Agent n. A line connects Agent 1, Agent 2, the unlabeled box, and Agent n. A line connects Agent 1 to Model and knowledge. A line connects Agent 2 to Model and knowledge. A line connects Agent n to Model and knowledge. An arrow points from a section that reads Chat output from agents to Accumulating chat thread. A line connects Accumulating chat thread to Result.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/group-chat-pattern.svg#lightbox)
[ ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/group-chat-pattern.svg#lightbox)
This pattern addresses scenarios that are best accomplished through group discussion to reach decisions. These scenarios might include collaborative ideation, structured validation, or quality control processes. The pattern supports various interaction modes, from free-flowing brainstorming to formal review workflows that have fixed roles and approval gates.
This pattern works well for human-in-the-loop scenarios where humans can optionally take on dynamic chat manager responsibilities and guide conversations toward productive outcomes. In this orchestration pattern, agents are typically in a _read-only_ mode. They don't use tools to make changes in running systems.
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#when-to-use-group-chat-orchestration)
### When to use group chat orchestration
Consider group chat orchestration when your scenario can be solved through spontaneous or guided collaboration or iterative maker-checker loops. All of these approaches support real-time human oversight or participation. Because all agents and humans in the loop emit output into a single accumulating thread, this pattern provides transparency and auditability.
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#collaborative-scenarios)
#### Collaborative scenarios
  * Creative brainstorming sessions where agents that have different perspectives and knowledge sources build on each other's contributions to the chat
  * Decision-making processes that benefit from debate and consensus-building
  * Decision-making scenarios that require iterative refinement through discussion
  * Multidisciplinary problems that require cross-functional dialogue


[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#validation-and-quality-control-scenarios)
#### Validation and quality control scenarios
  * Quality assurance requirements that involve structured review processes and iteration
  * Compliance and regulatory validation that requires multiple expert perspectives
  * Content creation workflows that require editorial review with a clear separation of concerns between creation and validation


[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#when-to-avoid-group-chat-orchestration)
### When to avoid group chat orchestration
Avoid this pattern in the following scenarios:
  * Simple task delegation or linear pipeline processing is sufficient.
  * Real-time processing requirements make discussion overhead unacceptable.
  * Clear hierarchical decision-making or deterministic workflows without discussion are more appropriate.
  * The chat manager has no objective way to determine whether the task is complete.


Managing conversation flow and preventing infinite loops require careful attention, especially as more agents make control more difficult to maintain. To maintain effective control, consider limiting group chat orchestration to three or fewer agents.
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#maker-checker-loops)
### Maker-checker loops
The maker-checker loop is a specific type of group chat orchestration where one agent, the _maker_ , creates or proposes something. Another agent, the _checker_ , provides a critique of the result. This pattern is iterative, with the checker agent pushing the conversation back to the maker agent to make updates and repeat the process. Although the group chat pattern doesn't require agents to _take turns_ chatting, the maker-checker loop requires a formal turn-based sequence that the chat manager drives.
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#group-chat-orchestration-example)
### Group chat orchestration example
A city parks and recreation department uses software that includes group chat orchestration to evaluate new park development proposals. The software reads the draft proposal, and multiple specialist agents debate different community impact perspectives and work toward consensus on the proposal. This process occurs before the proposal opens for community review to help anticipate the feedback that it might receive.
[ ![Diagram that shows group chat orchestration for municipal park planning with specialist city planning agents.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/group-chat-pattern-example.svg) ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/group-chat-pattern-example.svg#lightbox)

[ ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/group-chat-pattern-example.svg#lightbox)
The system processes park development proposals by initiating a group consultation with specialized municipal agents that engage in the task from multiple civic perspectives.
  * The _community engagement agent_ evaluates accessibility requirements, anticipated resident feedback, and usage patterns to ensure equitable community access.
  * The _environmental planning agent_ assesses ecological impact, sustainability measures, native vegetation displacement, and compliance with environmental regulations.
  * The _budget and operations agent_ analyzes construction costs, ongoing maintenance expenses, staffing requirements, and long-term operational sustainability.


The chat manager facilitates structured debate where agents challenge each other's recommendations and defend their reasoning. A parks department employee participates in the chat thread to add insight and respond to agents' knowledge requests in real time. This process enables the employee to update the original proposal to address identified concerns and better prepare for community feedback.

## Handoff orchestration
The handoff orchestration pattern enables dynamic delegation of tasks between specialized agents. Each agent can assess the task at hand and decide whether to handle it directly or transfer it to a more appropriate agent based on the context and requirements.
[ ![Diagram that shows handoff orchestration where an agent intelligently routes tasks to appropriate specialist agents based on dynamic analysis.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/handoff-pattern.svg) ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/handoff-pattern.svg#lightbox)
[ The image shows five key sections. The Agent 1 section includes input, a model and general knowledge section, and a result. The Agent 2 section includes a result and model and knowledge section. The Agent 3 section includes the model, knowledge, and tools section, a result, and an unlabeled section that connects to a result. The Agent n section includes a model and knowledge section and a result. The Customer support employee section includes a result. Curved arrows flow from agent to agent and to the customer support employee.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/handoff-pattern.svg#lightbox)
[ ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/handoff-pattern.svg#lightbox)
This pattern addresses scenarios where the optimal agent for a task isn't known upfront or where the task requirements become clear only during processing. It enables intelligent routing and ensures that tasks reach the most capable agent. Agents in this pattern don't typically work in parallel. Full control transfers from one agent to another agent.
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#when-to-use-handoff-orchestration)
### When to use handoff orchestration
Consider the agent handoff pattern in the following scenarios:
  * Tasks that require specialized knowledge or tools, but where the number of agents needed or their order can't be predetermined
  * Scenarios where expertise requirements emerge during processing, resulting in dynamic task routing based on content analysis
  * Multiple-domain problems that require different specialists who operate one at a time
  * Logical relationships and signals that you can predetermine to indicate when one agent reaches its capability limit and which agent should handle the task next


[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#when-to-avoid-handoff-orchestration)
### When to avoid handoff orchestration
Avoid this pattern in the following scenarios:
  * The appropriate agents and their order are always known upfront.
  * Task routing is simple and deterministically rule-based, not based on dynamic context window or dynamic interpretation.
  * Suboptimal routing decisions might lead to a poor or frustrating user experience.
  * Multiple operations should run concurrently to address the task.
  * Avoiding an infinite handoff loop or avoiding excessive bouncing between agents is challenging.


[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#agent-handoff-pattern-example)
### Agent handoff pattern example
A telecommunications customer relationship management (CRM) solution uses handoff agents in its customer support web portal. An initial agent begins helping customers but discovers that it needs specialized expertise during the conversation. The initial agent passes the task to the most appropriate agent to address the customer's concern. Only one agent at a time operates on the original input, and the handoff chain results in a single result.
[ ![Diagram that shows handoff orchestration where a triage agent intelligently routes questions to appropriate specialist agents based on dynamic analysis.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/handoff-pattern-example.svg) ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/handoff-pattern-example.svg#lightbox)
[ The image includes five key sections. The Triage support agent section includes a model and general knowledge section, input, and a result. The Technical infrastructure agent section includes a result and a model, infrastructure knowledge, and tools section. The Financial resolution agent section includes a model, billing account knowledge, and billing API access section, and a result. The Account access agent section includes a result and a model and customer knowledge section. The Customer support employee section includes a result. Curved arrows flow from agent to agent and to the Customer support employee.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/handoff-pattern-example.svg#lightbox)
[ ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/handoff-pattern-example.svg#lightbox)
In this system, the _triage support agent_ interprets the request and tries to handle common problems directly. When it reaches its limits, it hands network problems to a _technical infrastructure agent_ , billing disputes to a _financial resolution agent_ , and so on. Further handoffs occur within those agents when the current agent recognizes its own capability limits and knows another agent can better support the scenario.
Each agent is capable of completing the conversation if it determines that customer success has been achieved or that no other agent can further benefit the customer. Some agents are also designed to hand off the user experience to a human support agent when the problem is important to solve but no AI agent currently has the capabilities to address it.
One example of a handoff instance is highlighted in the diagram. It begins with the triage agent that hands off the task to the technical infrastructure agent. The technical infrastructure agent then decides to hand off the task to the financial resolution agent, which ultimately redirects the task to customer support.
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#magentic-orchestration)
## Magentic orchestration
The magentic orchestration pattern is designed for open-ended and complex problems that don't have a predetermined plan of approach. Agents in this pattern typically have tools that allow them to make direct changes in external systems. The focus is as much on building and documenting the approach to solve the problem as it is on implementing that approach. The task list is dynamically built and refined as part of the workflow through collaboration between specialized agents and a magentic manager agent. As the context evolves, the magentic manager agent builds a task ledger to develop the approach plan with goals and subgoals, which is eventually finalized, followed, and tracked to complete the desired outcome.
[ ![Diagram that shows magentic orchestration.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/magentic-pattern.svg) ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/magentic-pattern.svg#lightbox)
[ The image shows a Manager agent section. It includes the input and a model. An arrow labeled Invoke agents points from the Manager agent to Agent 2. An arrow labeled Evaluate goal loop points to the Task complete section. An arrow labeled Yes points to the Results section, and an arrow labeled No points back to the Manager agent. An arrow points from the Manager agent to the Task and progress ledger section. A line connects the Task and progress ledger section to the Human participant section. A line that has three arrows points to Agent 1, Agent 2, an unlabeled section, and Agent n. A line connects Agent 1 to a section that reads Model and knowledge. A line connects Agent 2 to a section that reads Model, knowledge, and tools. A line connects Agent n to Model and tools. An arrow points from the section that reads Model, knowledge, and tools to External systems and from the Model and tools section to External systems.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/magentic-pattern.svg#lightbox)
[ ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/magentic-pattern.svg#lightbox)
The manager agent communicates directly with specialized agents to gather information as it builds and refines the task ledger. It iterates, backtracks, and delegates as many times as needed to build a complete plan that it can successfully carry out. The manager agent frequently evaluates whether the original request is fully satisfied or stalled. It updates the ledger to adjust the plan.
In some ways, this orchestration pattern is an extension of the [group chat](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#group-chat-orchestration) pattern. The magentic orchestration pattern focuses on an agent that builds a plan of approach, while other agents use tools to make changes in external systems instead of only using their knowledge stores to reach an outcome.
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#when-to-use-magentic-orchestration)
### When to use magentic orchestration
Consider the magentic pattern in the following scenarios:
  * A complex or open-ended use case that has no predetermined solution path.
  * A requirement to consider input and feedback from multiple specialized agents to develop a valid solution path.
  * A requirement for the AI system to generate a fully developed plan of approach that a human can review before or after implementation.
  * Agents equipped with tools that interact with external systems, consume external resources, or can induce changes in running systems. A documented plan that shows how those agents are sequenced can be presented to a user before allowing the agents to follow the tasks.


[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#when-to-avoid-magentic-orchestration)
### When to avoid magentic orchestration
Avoid this pattern in the following scenarios:
  * The solution path is developed or should be approached in a deterministic way.
  * There's no requirement to produce a ledger.
  * The task has low complexity and a simpler pattern can solve it.
  * The work is time-sensitive, as the pattern focuses on building and debating viable plans, not optimizing for end results.
  * You anticipate frequent stalls or infinite loops that don't have a clear path to resolution.


[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#magentic-orchestration-example)
### Magentic orchestration example
A site reliability engineering (SRE) team built automation that uses magentic orchestration to handle low-risk incident response scenarios. When a service outage occurs within the scope of the automation, the system must dynamically create and implement a remediation plan. It does this without knowing the specific steps needed upfront.
[ ![Diagram that shows magentic orchestration for SRE automation.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/magentic-pattern-example.svg) ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/magentic-pattern-example.svg#lightbox)
[ The image shows the SRE automation manager agent section that includes input and a model. An arrow points from the SRE automation manager agent to the Task and progress ledger section. An arrow labeled Invoke knowledge and action agents points to a line that points to the Infrastructure, Diagnostics, Rollback, and Communication agents. An arrow labeled Evaluate goal loop points from the SRE automation manager agent to the Live-site issue resolved section. An arrow labeled Yes points from Live-site issue resolved to Result. The Task and progress ledger section includes a Resolution approach plan, Resolution task statuses, and the Live-site issue resolved section. An arrow labeled No points from the Live-site issue to the SRE automation manager agent. A line starts at the Diagnostic agent, goes through the Model and log and metrics knowledge section, and points to Workload systems. A line starts at the Infrastructure agent, goes through the model, graph knowledge, and CLI tools section, and joins the line that points to Workload systems. A line starts at the Rollback agent, goes through the model, Git access, CLI tools section, and points to Workload systems. A line starts at the Communication agent, goes through the Model and communication API access section, and points to the Human participant section.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/magentic-pattern-example.svg#lightbox)
[ ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/_images/magentic-pattern-example.svg#lightbox)
When the automation detects a qualifying incident, the _magentic manager agent_ begins by creating an initial task ledger with high-level goals such as restoring service availability and identifying the root cause. The manager agent then consults with specialized agents to gather information and refine the remediation plan.
  1. The _diagnostics agent_ analyzes system logs, performance metrics, and error patterns to identify potential causes. It reports findings back to the manager agent.
  2. Based on diagnostic results, the manager agent updates the task ledger with specific investigation steps and consults the _infrastructure agent_ to understand current system state and available recovery options.
  3. The _communication agent_ provides stakeholder notification capabilities, and the manager agent incorporates communication checkpoints and approval gates into the evolving plan according to the SRE team's escalation procedures.
  4. As the scenario becomes clearer, the manager agent might add the _rollback agent_ to the plan if deployment reversion is needed, or escalate to human SRE engineers if the incident exceeds the automation's scope.


Throughout this process, the manager agent continuously refines the task ledger based on new information. It adds, removes, or reorders tasks as the incident evolves. For example, if the diagnostics agent discovers a database connection problem, the manager agent might switch the entire plan from a deployment rollback strategy to a plan that focuses on restoring database connectivity.
The manager agent watches for excessive stalls in restoring service and guards against infinite remediation loops. It maintains a complete audit trail of the evolving plan and the implementation steps, which provides transparency for post-incident review. This transparency ensures that the SRE team can improve both the workload and the automation based on lessons learned.

## Implementation considerations
When you implement any of these agent design patterns, several considerations must be addressed. Reviewing these considerations helps you avoid common pitfalls and ensures that your agent orchestration is robust, secure, and maintainable.
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#single-agent-multitool)
### Single agent, multitool
You can address some problems with a single agent if you give it sufficient access to tools and knowledge sources. As the number of knowledge sources and tools increases, it becomes difficult to provide a predictable agent experience. If a single agent can reliably solve your scenario, consider adopting that approach. Decision-making and flow-control overhead often exceed the benefits of breaking the task into multiple agents. However, security boundaries, network line of sight, and other factors can still render a single-agent approach infeasible.
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#deterministic-routing)
### Deterministic routing
Some patterns require you to route flow between agents deterministically. Others rely on agents to choose their own routes. If your agents are defined in a no-code or low-code environment, you might not control those behaviors. If you define your agents in code by using SDKs like Semantic Kernel, you have more control.
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#context-window)
### Context window
AI agents often have limited context windows. This constraint can affect their ability to process complex tasks. When you implement these patterns, decide what context the next agent requires to be effective. In some scenarios, you need the full, raw context gathered so far. In other scenarios, a summarized or truncated version is more appropriate. If your agent can work without accumulated context and only requires a new instruction set, take that approach instead of providing context that doesn't help accomplish the agent's task.
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#reliability)
### Reliability
These patterns require properly functioning agents and reliable transitions between them. They often result in classical distributed systems problems such as node failures, network partitions, message loss, and cascading errors. Mitigation strategies should be in place to address these challenges. Agents and their orchestrators should do the following steps.
  * Implement timeout and retry mechanisms.
  * Include a graceful degradation implementation to handle one or more agents within a pattern faulting.
  * Surface errors instead of hiding them, so downstream agents and orchestrator logic can respond appropriately.
  * Consider circuit breaker patterns for agent dependencies.
  * Design agents to be as isolated as is practical from each other, with single points of failure not shared between agents. For example:
    * Ensure compute isolation between agents.
    * Evaluate how using a single models as a service (MaaS) model or a shared knowledge store can result in rate limiting when agents run concurrently.
  * Use checkpoint features available in your SDK to help recover from an interrupted orchestration, such as from a fault or a new code deployment.


[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#security)
### Security
Implementing proper security mechanisms in these design patterns minimizes the risk of exposing your AI system to attacks or data leakage. Securing communication between agents and limiting each agent's access to sensitive data are key security design strategies. Consider the following security measures:
  * Implement authentication and use secure networking between agents.
  * Consider data privacy implications of agent communications.
  * Design audit trails to meet compliance requirements.
  * Design agents and their orchestrators to follow the principle of least privilege.
  * Consider how to handle the user's identity across agents. Agents must have broad access to knowledge stores to handle requests from all users, but they must not return data that's inaccessible to the user. Security trimming must be implemented in every agent in the pattern.


[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#observability-and-testing)
### Observability and testing
Distributing your AI system across multiple agents requires monitoring and testing each agent individually, as well as the system as a whole, to ensure proper functionality. When you design your observability and testing strategies, consider the following recommendations:
  * Instrument all agent operations and handoffs. Troubleshooting distributed systems is a computer science challenge, and orchestrated AI agents are no exception.
  * Track performance and resource usage metrics for each agent so that you can establish a baseline, find bottlenecks, and optimize.
  * Design testable interfaces for individual agents.
  * Implement integration tests for multi-agent workflows.


[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#common-pitfalls-and-anti-patterns)
### Common pitfalls and anti-patterns
Avoid these common mistakes when you implement agent orchestration patterns:
  * Creating unnecessary coordination complexity by using a complex pattern when simple sequential or concurrent orchestration would suffice.
  * Adding agents that don't provide meaningful specialization.
  * Overlooking latency impacts of multiple-hop communication.
  * Sharing mutable state between concurrent agents, which can result in transactionally inconsistent data because of assuming synchronous updates across agent boundaries.
  * Using deterministic patterns for workflows that are inherently nondeterministic.
  * Using nondeterministic patterns for workflows that are inherently deterministic.
  * Ignoring resource constraints when you choose concurrent orchestration.
  * Consuming excessive model resources because context windows grow as agents accumulate more information and consult their model to make progress on their task.


[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#combining-orchestration-patterns)
### Combining orchestration patterns
Applications sometimes require you to combine multiple orchestration patterns to address their requirements. For example, you might use sequential orchestration for the initial data processing stages and then switch to concurrent orchestration for parallelizable analysis tasks. Don't try to make one workflow fit into a single pattern when different stages of your workload have different characteristics and can benefit from each stage using a different pattern.
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#relationship-to-cloud-design-patterns)
## Relationship to cloud design patterns
AI agent orchestration patterns extend and complement traditional [cloud design patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/) by addressing the unique challenges of coordinating intelligent, autonomous components. Cloud design patterns focus on structural and behavioral concerns in distributed systems, but AI agent orchestration patterns specifically address the coordination of components with reasoning capabilities, learning behaviors, and nondeterministic outputs.
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#implementations-in-microsoft-semantic-kernel)
## Implementations in Microsoft Semantic Kernel
Many of these patterns rely on a code-based implementation to address the orchestration logic. The Agent Framework within Semantic Kernel provides support for many of the following [Agent Orchestration patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/frameworks/agent/agent-orchestration/):
  * [Sequential orchestration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/frameworks/agent/agent-orchestration/sequential)
  * [Concurrent orchestration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/frameworks/agent/agent-orchestration/concurrent)
  * [Group Chat orchestration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/frameworks/agent/agent-orchestration/group-chat)
  * [Handoff orchestration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/frameworks/agent/agent-orchestration/handoff)
  * [Magentic orchestration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/frameworks/agent/agent-orchestration/magentic)


For hands-on implementation, explore [Semantic Kernel multi-agent orchestration samples](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/tree/main/python/samples/getting_started_with_agents) on GitHub that demonstrate these patterns in practice. You can also find many of these patterns in [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/core-user-guide/design-patterns/intro.html), such as [Magentic-One](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/magentic-one.html).
[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns#implementations-in-azure-ai-foundry-agent-service)
## Implementations in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service
You can also use the [Azure AI Foundry Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/overview) to chain agents together in relatively simple workflows by using its [connected agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/connected-agents) functionality. The workflows that you implement by using this service are primarily nondeterministic, which limits which patterns can be fully implemented in this no-code environment.

These capabilities deliver essential support for [AI agent](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/ai-agents/) protocols, like Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent2Agent (A2A), by allowing customers to make any existing integration, API, and application accessible and understandable by AI agents and build multi-agent workflows with robust governance. And, with new generative AI development tools for increased developer productivity, [MuleSoft](https://www.salesforce.com/mulesoft/?d=cta-body-promo-8) is helping organizations accelerate their transformation into agent-driven enterprises. 
With the recent launch of [Salesforce Agentforce 3](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/06/23/agentforce-3-announcement/), which includes native MCP support, customers can also use MuleSoft‚Äôs new features to turn [APIs](https://www.mulesoft.com/api/what-is-an-api) into MCP servers and extend Agentforce with new opportunities for agent interoperability without compromising control.
For example, the new MuleSoft capabilities allow organizations to automate IT issue resolution to enhance customer experiences while enabling IT teams to focus on more strategic, high-value work. Customers can build an observability agent that detects a critical server error in an observability and security platform like Datadog (agent-to-system) and alerts the specialized database triage agent (agent-to-agent). They can also expand the workflow to enable the triage agent to then query a knowledge base for the error signature, identify the fix, and instruct a remediation agent to restart the appropriate cloud service and post a status update to Slack (agent-to-agent to agent-to-system).
#### **Why it matters**
As modern businesses adopt more AI agents and the [number of applications and AI models they use multiplies](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/connectivity-report-announcement-2025/), their technology infrastructure becomes increasingly complex and siloed. In fact, integration is one of the biggest barriers between AI‚Äôs promise and enterprise reality, with [95% of IT leaders](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/connectivity-report-announcement-2025/) citing it as the top hurdle to making AI effective. The existing enterprise architecture is built for running applications, but it‚Äôs not equipped to manage thousands ‚Äî or tens of thousands ‚Äî of agents across the enterprise. This radical shift introduces an entirely new class of challenges around orchestration, integration, and governance. 
MuleSoft has long been a leader in helping organizations digitally transform for the AI era, empowering them with tools for integration, APIs, and automation. Now, as agents become central to an organization‚Äôs competitive advantage, MuleSoft‚Äôs agent [orchestration](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/esb/what-application-orchestration) capabilities provide organizations with new tools for agentic transformation.
#### **Go deeper**
MuleSoft‚Äôs new AI and agent-focused capabilities are critical in preparing customers for the autonomous enterprise.
**New agent orchestration capabilities include:**
**MCP support**
MCP is rapidly gaining momentum as a standardized, open-source framework for enabling seamless and secure bidirectional communication between [LLMs](https://www.salesforce.com/artificial-intelligence/what-are-large-language-models/) or AI agents and diverse external systems like Salesforce. 
[MuleSoft MCP Support](https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/ai/model-context-protocol/?d=cta-body-promo-8) enables integrations with LLMs and enterprise systems with just a few clicks and provides agents with the ability to take action in any system with [governance](https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/ai/ai-agent-governance/?d=cta-body-promo-8). 
  * **MuleSoft MCP Connector** ‚Äî Transform any application or API into an agent-ready asset by bringing MCP to every API
  * **MuleSoft for Agentforce: Topic Center** ‚Äî
  * **MuleSoft Flex Gateway: MCP Support** ‚Äî Secure and standardize communication with AI agents and models through a unified platform

**A2A support**
The A2A protocol is also growing in popularity as an essential standard for enabling secure, scalable, and discoverable communication among multiple AI agents. A2A focuses on direct agent-to-agent collaboration, addressing the critical need for a common language between diverse AI models.
[MuleSoft A2A Support](https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/ai/a2a-support/?d=cta-body-promo-8) enables secure A2A communication and discoverability across the agentic enterprise.
  * **MuleSoft A2A Connector** ‚Äî Create seamless communication across any agent by exposing them as an A2A server or client
  * **MuleSoft Flex Gateway: A2A support** ‚Äî Use a unified gateway to allow agents to find each other to accomplish multi-step tasks quickly

#### [AI agent ecosystem Understand how orchestrating intelligence across your AI agent ecosystem is critical for enduring success in this next era of enterprise AI.  ](https://www.huronconsultinggroup.com/insights/agentic-ai-agent-orchestration#Orchestrate_intelligence_across_your_AI_agent_ecosystem_5155F83F0E8041E7B1C2C0549251E6A4)
## Overview: What is agentic AI and agent orchestration?
Artificial intelligence is evolving from task-specific tools to systems that can manage entire workflows. We already automate complex processes across industries, such as:
  * Discharge planning in healthcare 
  * Grants management in higher education 
  * Financial close in finance


These solutions are often rule-based, relying on predefined logic and structured pathways. But rules are not always available or obvious, and in these cases, we resort to our innate ability to complete a task using reason. Agentic AI represents the next step. 
Agentic AI enables systems to perform human-like reasoning to determine what to do to complete a task. It includes capabilities that allow systems to interpret context, adapt plans in real time, and coordinate across functions and platforms. This evolution builds directly on the foundations of automation, enabling a shift from static process automation to dynamic, end-to-end workflow management. 
The impact is significant. Organizations that embrace agentic AI can reduce manual coordination, accelerate cycle times, and improve decision quality at scale. But capturing this value requires leaders to rethink how work is done and how systems are designed. 
Optimizing individual applications or hardcoding integrations is no longer sufficient. Instead, systems must be built for interoperability, context awareness, and real-time orchestration. Success depends on aligning AI capabilities with business priorities, data architecture, and governance; most importantly, we must ensure humans and machines can operate cohesively across workflows. 
  

#### What are AI agents? 
AI agents are specialized software entities designed to autonomously achieve defined goals by continuously observing data, assessing options through logical reasoning, and executing actions independently or with minimal human intervention. Examples include virtual customer service agents that handle complex inquiries around the clock, digital procurement assistants that autonomously manage vendor interactions, and healthcare agents capable of drafting preliminary clinical appeal letters based on contextual analysis. 
  

#### What is agentic AI? 
Agentic AI refers to a system-level capability that enables software entities to pursue broader objectives through long-horizon planning, contextual decision-making, and dynamic coordination of multiple tasks or agents. 
Unlike task-specific AI agents, agentic AI can understand the bigger picture, adapt to changing conditions in real time, and orchestrate actions across functions, systems, and stakeholders. 
Examples include:
  * AI-driven hospital discharge managers that coordinate across care teams, pharmacy, and transport based on real-time status 
  * Financial close assistants that manage dependencies across multiple entities and systems to streamline month-end processes

#### How do AI agents and agentic AI relate? 
AI agents are functional building blocks, each designed to perform a specific task with autonomy. Agentic AI brings these building blocks together, adding the ability to reason across tasks, manage priorities, and orchestrate them in service of a broader goal.
In essence, AI agents execute. Agentic AI governs and coordinates, enabling intelligent end-to-end workflow management. 
  

#### What is agent orchestration? 
Agent orchestration is the coordinated management of multiple AI agents or digital systems to achieve complex goals more efficiently and intelligently. Rather than relying on a single solution to handle every task, agent orchestration brings together specialized agents with distinct capabilities to collaborate, adapt, and solve challenges in real time. 
By integrating decision making, communication, and task execution across systems, organizations can scale their operations, personalize experiences, and drive faster outcomes. As AI continues to evolve, and agents become more prolific, orchestrating multiple agents effectively will be critical to building flexible, resilient technology ecosystems that align to enterprise goals. 
  

#### Why now? Technology and market forces are converging. 
Accelerated adoption of agent orchestration stems from a convergence of technological advancements and economic necessities. Key developments include: 
  * **Generative AI breakthroughs:** Generative AI (GenAI) innovations, like ChatGPT and similar models, have significantly advanced AI capabilities, lowering the barrier to implementing sophisticated agent systems. 
  * **Composable architectures:** Organizations are increasingly adopting modular, composable architectures, enabling rapid deployment, testing, and scaling of AI agents without extensive overhauls. 
  * **Hyperscaler toolkits:** Major cloud providers (AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud) now offer comprehensive, easy-to-implement toolkits that reduce the technical and financial barriers to agent orchestration. 


These advancements have democratized access to sophisticated AI capabilities, making scalable, enterprise-level orchestration achievable across industries. 
As organizations increasingly integrate AI, orchestration emerges as a strategic imperative rather than an optional component. It determines whether investments result in sustainable growth and innovation or become isolated experiments with limited impact. 
To facilitate effective orchestration, leaders must consider three interconnected perspectives: their workforce design, their solutions ecosystem, and their technical architecture. 
  

**_[Start a conversation with one of Huron‚Äôs AI experts to discuss agent orchestration in your environment.](https://www.huronconsultinggroup.com/forms/contact-an-expert?Expert=Fanny+Ip)_**
### Rethink your workforce design
Digital agents are rapidly becoming crucial workforce components, already demonstrating measurable value across industries. AI agents currently approve low-risk invoices, facilitate overnight customer onboarding, and, [according to Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-03-05-gartner-predicts-agentic-ai-will-autonomously-resolve-80-percent-of-common-customer-service-issues-without-human-intervention-by-20290#:~:text=Gartner%20Predicts%20Agentic%20AI%20Will,Without%20Human%20Intervention%20by%202029), are predicted to autonomously resolve approximately 80% of common customer service issues without human intervention.
As the technology evolves, agents will take on increasingly complex and nuanced work. Organizations must view these agents as integral teammates, rather than mere technological add-ons, to unlock significant gains in capacity, compliance, and operational speed. 
  

#### Agents are essential workforce units
Practical implementations clearly demonstrate the growing role of agents within workforce strategies: 
  * **Finance and procurement:** Agents autonomously manage invoice pre-approvals, significantly reducing processing times and error rates. 
  * **Customer operations:** Digital agents conduct seamless overnight customer onboarding and compliance document collection, ensuring faster customer activation and improved satisfaction. 
  * **IT services:** AI-driven triage agents independently resolve nearly half of all IT tickets, substantially reducing resolution times and freeing IT personnel for more complex tasks. 


By embedding agents deeply into operational processes, organizations enhance efficiency and redeploy human talent to higher-value strategic activities. 
  

#### Operating models must change in the wake of agent-orchestrated work 
Effective integration of digital agents into the workforce requires organizations to rethink traditional operating models: roles and responsibilities, governance and compliance, processes, metrics, and talent/culture. 
  

**Roles and responsibilities**
To lead in this new paradigm, organizations must move beyond a binary view of ‚Äúhuman versus agent‚Äù and instead evaluate tasks across a spectrum: 
  * **Which tasks can be orchestrated entirely by agents to unlock capacity and speed?**
  * **What tasks benefit from human-AI collaboration or augmentation?**
  * **What should remain the domain of human judgment, empathy, or creativity?**


These considerations ensure clear accountability and optimized resource allocation. Tasks suitable for agent delegation typically feature high repetition, clearly defined rules, significant data intensity, and minimal empathy or subjective decision-making requirements. Human roles focus increasingly on strategic oversight, complex problem-solving, empathy-driven interactions, and nuanced judgment. 
  

**Governance and compliance**
The integration of agents necessitates robust governance structures, including: 
  * **Explicit human-in-the-loop policies**
  * **Comprehensive auditable activity logs**
  * **Clearly defined board-level oversight protocols**


These governance practices mitigate risks, address regulatory concerns, and build stakeholder trust by ensuring transparency and accountability in agent-driven decisions. 
  

**Processes need to be re-imagined**
Think of agents as one of the swim lanes in your business process designs. Successfully embedding agents into workflows requires organizations to systematically reimagine processes using structured methodologies: 
  * **Knowledge curation:** Build structured, accessible knowledge bases and datasets that agents can reference to act reliably and accurately. 
  * **Workflow decomposition:** Break down processes into tasks to identify potential entry points for agents. 
  * **Task scoring:** Evaluate each task based on repetition frequency, associated risk level, data processing requirements, and necessity for human empathy. 
  * **Allocation strategy:** Clearly and deliberately assign tasks to agents, humans, or hybrid teams, explicitly detailing compliance checkpoints and control measures. 


This rigorous methodology helps organizations maximize efficiency and compliance while delineating responsibilities across human and digital workers. 
  

**Workforce strategies must shift, introducing new KPIs**
The advent of agent-orchestrated work demands a recalibration of workforce management and performance measurement approaches: 
  * **Capacity hours released:** Quantify the workforce capacity freed by agents handling repetitive tasks, providing clear insight into productivity gains. 
  * **Decision latency:** Measure and monitor the time reduction caused by agent assistance in reaching operational decisions or process completions. 
  * **Escalation rate:** Track the frequency and types of tasks escalated from agents to human counterparts, providing critical insights into agent effectiveness and areas for improvement. 


Additionally, organizations must prioritize upskilling human employees in areas such as agent prompt design, agent oversight, and collaborative problem-solving. 
The role and function of AI agents will continue to evolve, so organizations should foster a culture of work agility and continuous learning over the long term. This ensures human teams effectively partner with AI agents, maximizing organizational efficiency and innovation. 
  

**Human workers need to be prepared for agent-orchestrated teams**
Successful integration of digital agents hinges on technical implementation, but more importantly, on robust human-centric change-management strategies. Employees should be provided with clear communication, targeted training, and continuous support to comfortably adapt to collaborative interactions with AI teammates. 
Actively involving employees in AI implementation creates a sense of ownership that increases adoption rates while allowing organizations to benefit from front-line insights that lead to more effective customization. 
Transparent discussions on agent capabilities, limitations, and expected workflows alleviate fears and build confidence, paving the way for smoother transitions and increased adoption. 
  

#### Embrace the hybrid workforce model 
Hybrid human-agent teams represent the future workforce model. Organizations that can successfully blend human intelligence with AI agent capabilities gain competitive advantages through improved operational efficiency, enhanced employee engagement, and superior customer experiences. 
Digital agents become active teammates, with clearly defined roles, metrics, onboarding processes, and career-development pathways aligned similarly to human employees. Implementing and sustaining this type of model is a team effort and requires the partnership of functional experts, IT, and human resources at each step.

### Orchestrate intelligence across your AI agent ecosystem
Every major technology vendor is embedding intelligent agents into their platforms. From Salesforce to ServiceNow, Microsoft to AWS, enterprises are seeing a surge in AI-driven copilots, assistants, and automation bots. While these tools offer valuable localized intelligence, they also introduce complexity and fragmentation. 
> CIOs face a crucial question: How can we harness the benefits of AI agents without introducing chaos?‚Äù 
A strategic framework for orchestrating AI agents at an enterprise scale is necessary. As every major platform embeds intelligent agents, CIOs must address how to coordinate, govern, and scale them across a fragmented landscape. Orchestration, more so than individual agent design, is the key to delivering consistent, enterprise-wide intelligence.
  

#### The emerging enterprise agent ecosystem 
As enterprises increasingly adopt AI, a new agentic architecture is taking shape. This architecture separates the execution of intelligent tasks from the orchestration of workflows. Understanding this shift requires distinguishing between the types of agents deployed and the platforms that coordinate them. 
  

##### Types of agents and where they operate
**Application-bound agents**
  * Embedded within enterprise application suites such as Workday, Oracle, and Salesforce
  * Deliver context-aware intelligence that is tightly integrated into the workflows, data models, and security frameworks of the host application
  * Effective for specific use cases, but operate in silos and are limited to their native environment


**Application-specific, externally-hosted agents**
  * Designed to support a particular application or domain, like payroll in Oracle or case management in Salesforce, but are built and run outside the application itself
  * May be hosted on platforms like ServiceNow, Azure, or a custom orchestration layer 
  * Allows for more flexible control, broader integration, or adherence to enterprise architecture standards, while still focusing on a single system


**Cross-application agents**
  * Designed to operate across multiple systems
  * Frequently developed using platforms such as Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, ServiceNow, or UiPath
  * General purpose, configurable, and capable of interacting with APIs, tools, and data sources beyond any single application
  * Often serve as building blocks for broader automation and decisioning strategies

  

##### How agents are orchestrated
**Vertical orchestration:** Agents are managed internally within a platform such as Workday, Oracle, or Salesforce. These systems coordinate tasks within their own workflows, data models, and rules. Orchestration is tightly integrated but confined to the host application.
**Horizontal orchestration:** Agents can be coordinated across systems. It includes two subtypes:
  * **Hyperscaler platforms:** Providers such as Azure, AWS, and Google offer orchestration tools within their cloud ecosystems. These support multi-agent workflows but often assume use of native infrastructure and services.
  * **Neutral platforms:** Platforms like UiPath, ServiceNow, MuleSoft, and Boomi offer vendor-agnostic orchestration. They are designed to integrate across diverse systems, making them well-suited for complex enterprise environments.


##### Convergence of roles
The boundaries between agent providers and orchestrators are beginning to blur. Some platforms that initially focused on embedding agents within their own environments are evolving to coordinate workflows across multiple systems. This shift reflects a broader trend toward combining vertical control with horizontal extensibility, enabling unified management of both native and external agents.
  

#### CIO imperative: Architect intelligence, not complexity
As intelligent tools multiply, the role of IT must evolve from operating and perfecting individual agents to designing systems that enable agents to work together safely and effectively. The priority, then, is to establish an AI orchestration layer that can coordinate distributed agents and apply enterprise policies that account for responsibility, governance, and optimization. 
  

#### Strategic design: Principles for enterprise AI orchestration
The following principles are designed to help IT leaders decide where intelligence should live, how it should be coordinated, and what should be governed centrally.
**1. Anchor agents where the data lives**
Deploy agents in the systems that own the data or the system-specific business process they support. Application-based agents are often best suited for tasks that require native context, platform-specific workflows, or user experience continuity. Use them for automation within a single application, not across them.
**2. Use centralized intelligence for cross-system logic**
When workflows or decisions span multiple platforms, orchestration must shift to a centralized layer. Hyperscaler or neutral orchestration platforms can manage logic across applications using LLM-native tools like memory, retrieval, and function chaining. This is where horizontal intelligence belongs.
**3. Architect for change, not just control**
The AI landscape is evolving rapidly. Prioritize agent orchestration models that are modular and interoperable. Favor open APIs, loosely coupled systems, and abstraction layers that allow you to adapt without starting over.
**4. Govern where you have control**
Not all platforms offer equal visibility or control. Ensure agent orchestration happens in environments where you can apply enterprise-wide policies and monitor behavior. Build governance into the orchestration layer from the start, with clear policies, escalation paths, and lifecycle management.
**5. Design for the user‚Äôs work surface**
Agents should meet users where they are, whether in Teams, Slack, ServiceNow, or other frontline tools. 
As agentic systems mature, they are evolving into the primary interface through which users interact with enterprise systems. This flips the traditional UX paradigm - from navigating multiple applications and forms to simply stating intent (e.g. ‚ÄúStart onboarding for Jane Doe‚Äù) and letting the agent handle the workflow.
In this model, UX is no longer defined by screens and clicks, but by intent to conversation to action. Intelligence should be surfaced at the point of interaction, not just where the logic resides. A seamless user experience is essential to adoption and trust.
  

#### Example in practice: Coordinating an employee onboarding workflow
Consider a common enterprise scenario: employee onboarding. HR manages hiring in Workday, IT handles equipment provisioning in ServiceNow, and identity creation is handled through Azure Active Directory. Each platform now includes its own embedded agent, each capable of automating part of the process. However, if these agents operate in isolation, the result is fragmented automation, duplicated logic, and limited visibility across the workflow. 
In this employee onboarding scenario, a viable solution is to orchestrate in ServiceNow, which benefits from being a platform for both vertical and horizontal orchestration.
To address this, organizations need a unified orchestration layer that can coordinate actions across systems, trigger workflows through APIs, and deliver a consistent user experience. 
This onboarding example brings several key principles into focus:
  * Anchor intelligence where the source data resides, such as Workday for HR-specific processes
  * Centralize logic when it spans multiple systems
  * Surface workflows in the tools employees already use
  * Choose orchestration models that can evolve as the environment changes


A well-designed orchestration layer transforms a collection of isolated tools into a unified system capable of delivering consistent, context-aware intelligence at scale. As we enter the next era of enterprise AI, success will be defined by the strength of an organization‚Äôs connective architecture.
